<h2>Upgraded Pager script from tugamars by me, panda :)</h2>
<p>
Everybody is free to use and modify this script!<br>
Credits for the original creator and me would be nice ofc :D<br>
</p>
<p>
This script was made in "NINETY SIX RP" as a mobile phone replacement!<br>
Right now, you can only use it with QBX-Core.<br>
(unless you can code and replace the events)<br>
