# 96rp_pager
Upgraded Pager script from tugamars by me, panda :)<br>
Everybody is free to use and modify this script!<br>
Credits for the original creator and me would be nice ofc :D<br>

This script was made in "NINETY SIX RP" as a mobile phone replacement!
Right now, you can only use it with QBX-Core. 
(unless you can code and replace the events)
